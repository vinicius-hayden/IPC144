1. Yes I do. I have an intermediate level at JavaScript with React Framework, HTML and CSS with Bootstrap and Java with Spring boot. I've built projects using and creating from scratch rest APIS and connecting all to a SQL database server.

2. From what I understand, the computer only understands a sequence of 0 and 1. When we write a code on a IDE, the computer does not understand the codes we use. In order to read our program, it is necessary to Compile the program to run it.

3. I want to, first of all, learn and achieve good and satisfactory scores in this score. I want to follow Software Engineering carrier because I am passionate about coding and transforming computer scripts into products and using them to solve real life problems. I will be the third generation programmer in my Family and I'm looking forward to do my best to learn and share everything here at Seneca. In the IPC144 I'm expecting to learn the basics of the C language which is really important, I already know some of the programming principles but reviewing it and learning it in a different language with different people from different backgrounds is really cool!
