1. One type validates the condition to enter in the loop  at the beggining (while), 
the second (do while) validates the condition to keep in the loop at the end of the statement. For example, in the program, when we se the options to forecast the wish list, it keeps asking until the user types 0 to quit. The last one (for loop), 
when talking about Array, it is always preferred because in it we know how many iterations we need to reach the end of the array, and the loop is sequetional, meaning one after the other. 

2. To make sure I was getting the expected outputs, I used printf to know what data I was getting. I also of course compared the results with the Workshop PDF. I also isolated specific parts of the program in which I was having troubles in a different file to turn the task of do input and change the logic in an easy way. 

3. I should input the value in the exact order as described on the exercise, in that case I should enter 0 instead of 567.89. The w6p2_master_output.txt would also be helpful, because I would compare it to my output.txt so I would see every errors and try to fix them in my code.
